Hello, my name is Alexis Olson. I am a student at the University of Montana. My degree is in business management. 
I decided to take this class to learn more about how to manage my own website. I hope to learn things that are applicable to what I use my website for such as, accepting payments and capturing leads. The photo I uploaded is a picture of me in Hawaii with my boyfriend and his family last summer.
