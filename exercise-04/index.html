       <h1>Lyrics</h1>
       <br>
       <p><b>Black Dehlia</b><br>
<br>
You should write a song where the concept is<br>
You're basically writing like a love letter, or like a piece of advice<br>
To your mother, when she was your age<br>
I don't know<br>
Maybe I would write you a happy ending<br>
I would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning<br>
I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you<br>
And let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you<br>
Or maybe I'm naïve<br>
Maybe I'm just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed<br>
It would somehow grow inside you<br>
Spent so much of my time wishing you were different<br>
But reality is that with life can't never be provision<br>
But if I could wish for one thing, I'd go back and I'd fix it<br>
I'd tackle all your obstacles and kill 'em with precision<br>
And better the intentions of every single person<br>
Who'd play a part in you learning exactly what your worth is<br>
I'd shower you with purpose, I'd wipe hate off the surface<br>
I'd reshape all your pain and make it fucking worth it<br>
No more feeling worthless, no more fucking searching<br>
No more of that fraud shit, nobody else could hurt you<br>
Yeah, said nobody else could hurt you<br>
And if they ever tried too I'd wipe 'em from the Earth too<br>
'Cause I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too<br>
I know that you been running from everything that's behind you<br>
I know you've been burying everything deep inside you<br>
I can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you<br>
But I'm stuck sitting in this time frame<br>
Struggling with my demons and playing these stupid mind game<br>
One day it could get better, maybe it could get better<br>
Maybe we could change shit, no more inclement weather<br>
Know you hated your mom, know it went through your mind<br>
You were just like me, wish that you had more time<br>
To see life from a different angle, wrestle with a different angel<br>
Wouldn't lose your wings and fall from heaven like a cliffhanger<br>
Everything is different now, nothing is the same<br>
And nowadays I swear it feels like you don't know my name<br>
But I look at the mirror and I see you every day<br>
I'm you in every way, every hue and every shade<br>
And maybe you should know, it's the last thing that I wanted<br>
'Cause what I hate about you makes me feel like I'm haunted<br>
And I don't wanna spend the rest of my time on the run and-<br>
So I'm just gonna confront it, yeah I'm just gonna confront it<br>
And tell you that I love you for everything you made me<br>
And that you need to hear this even if it makes you angry<br>
God lives inside you, you've already found him<br>
The Devil lives in memories and you just let him hound you<br>
And I despise your church for every fucking thing they taught you<br>
It's just a fucking stain that I wish I could wipe off you<br>
That I wish I could wipe off you<br>
And I forgive you for doing everything that it cost you<br>
Everything that it caused price I wish it didn't cost you<br>
Losing a part of me that would follow you to Hell<br>
Follow you to hatred, or follow you to jail<br>
Followed you to patterns that I could never get out of<br>
Now I realize that I could never make it with that love<br>
Now I realize that shit is the alternative outcome<br>
Never wanted you to save me, I just wish I count some<br>
I just wish that you grew up with someone you could count on<br>
I wish you knew that you could never make it without love<br>
For your goddamn self, and that you never ever find it in anybody else<br>
'Cause I would help you find you<br>
And if I saw it killing you I swear I would revive you<br>
And if that meant the end of me<br>
I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy end in peace<br>
Because, you are such a special thing<br>
You're not just my mom, but you're the reason I exist<br>
And the best life that you could've had for yourself without making a mistake<br>
Would have meant I woulda had a nicer childhood<br>
And even though my childhood wasn't perfect and I still love you<br>
I just want you to know that if I could go back and do one thing for you<br>
Or be one person for you<br>
I would make sure, not just for my sake, but so that you could've had a nicer life<br>
And a nicer childhood, that you know<br>
You would not have made the mistakes that put us all in this bad situation<br>
And not have the strength to leave<br>
But just so that you would have been happier and stronger<br>
Even if I didn't exist, even it meant that I was never born<br>
That's what I would have wanted for you<br>
Yeah, and if that meant the end of me<br>
I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy ending<br>
'Cause I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too<br>
I know you've been running from everything that's behind you<br>
I know that you've been burying everything deep inside you<br>
I can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you<br>
And if that meant the end of me<br>
I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy ending<br>
And if that meant the end of me<br>
I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy ending<br>
And if that meant the end of me<br>
I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy ending<br>
I don't know<br>
Maybe I would write you a happy ending<br>
I would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning<br>
I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you<br>
And let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you<br>
Or maybe I'm naïve<br>
Maybe I'm just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed<br>
It would somehow grow inside you<br>
And that I could hide you from the rain<br>
So that it could be easier for happiness to find you<br>
Or maybe I'm still a kid who's caught in a dream<br>
I'm the heir to the throne of a princess who's still trying to be queen<br>
Or maybe we're all just caught in the winds of a massacre<br>
The blackened leaves of dying, black dahlias
