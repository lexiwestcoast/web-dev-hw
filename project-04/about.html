            <h2>Alexis Olson</h2>
            <p class="title">CEO & Founder of Alive & Aligned, LLC</p>
            <p>Growing up, I loved sports but was a mediocre athlete.
              Even though I wasn’t leading the team or breaking records,
              I was having fun and felt alive while competing.

Sometimes, life changes and I started down a path that I knew I had to correct.
I was quickly becoming unhealthy and unrecognizable in the mirror. It was at
 that moment that I decided to change my life trajectory and recommit to my
 fitness journey.

However, I had a lot of work to do from a childhood eating disorder coming back
to chronic fatigue, anxiety and sometimes depression.

I knew there had to be something going on so I began researching and learned
about Adaptogens and holistic approaches to healing myself inside and out.

You know what? My education and hard work paid off and I am now the woman that
 I want to be.

It was with this personal success that I realized I wasn’t the only one in this
position. There are many more like me.

That is the moment I decided to become a trainer to help others change their
 life trajectory and become the person they want to be.</p>
