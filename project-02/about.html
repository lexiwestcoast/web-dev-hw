  <title>3 Steps to Manifesting Anything You Want</title>



  </head>

  <body>

    <p>I have been using manifestation for the last 4 years pretty seriously. <br>
    <br> I think a lot of people don't think that it works, even though my life
    is proof that it does! In my early twenties I had a handful of mentors who
    greatly impacted my life and taught me a lot of the practices I still use
    today. Some of these mentors I had never met and others I worked closely
    with. I've learned that life doesn't always get better by just letting
    time pass by, but when we are clear about what we want. My favorite quote
    from one of my mentors Lisa Grossmann is, "if you don't master the law of
    specificity, then you will master in mediocrity." That's why getting clear
    about what I want in my life, how I want to feel and being an active
    particiapte in my life is so important to me. It doesn't have to be called
    "manifestation" if that doesn't resonate with you. Whatever you want to call
    it, it works.
    <br>
    <br><div>My favorite manifestation teachers include Amanda Frances. Her course, Money
    Mentality Makeover changed my life. I've consumed all of her free content
    on social media, including her meditations on Youtube. I also recommend
    Monica Yates. She teaches a lot on abundance and using manifesation with
    your health / body. I really enjoyed her Be a Lover, Not a Mother course.
    She specializes in emobdying your feminine energy and not emasculating men.
    <br><br>
    Lastly, my go-to foundational resource is Abraham Hicks. They have books
    such as, Ask and it is Given (which is what these three steps are from) and
    an endless library of short talks on manifestation, Law of Attraction and
    how to use these principles in your life.
