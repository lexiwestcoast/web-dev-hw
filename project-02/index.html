    <h1><u>3 Steps to Manifesting Anything You Want</u></h1>

      <ol>
    <li><h2>1. Ask</h2></li>
              <p>Step 1 is ask. Often times we spend a great deal talking about
                what we don't want and we are really good about doing this in
                detail. This can come in the form of complaining, or describing
                our current reality. Some examples are talking about how you
              never have money, how broke you are, complaining about the
            economy, etc. While all of this may be true <i>now</i> it isn't
          putting a great deal of energy into what you <b>do want</b>.
        So what do you want? Write it down without negatives. Meaning, if you
      want more money, write how much money you want, don't write down
    that you don't want to be broke anymore, this only perpetuates the energy
  of being broke and not having enough.</p>

    <li><h2>2. It is Given (no work on your part)</h2></li>
    <br><p>I like to describe this step as having fun and living your life.
    By the time you get to Step 2 you already know what you want, you wrote
    it down. As Abraham Hicks says you are now beating the drum of what
  you would like to receive more of rather than what you're lacking. You have
clarity. Step 2 is about staying in the energy of clarity. Knowing you get to
have what you want and that it isn't your job to stay caught up in the energy
of "how". How it's going to come, when it's going to come, etc. All of those
details is staying attached rather than detached. Step 2 is about knowing you
get to have it and focusing on things in your life that make you feel good now.
You're in the in between phase, which is the juiciest phase. You know it's coming,
you're living your best life in the meantime as if it is already here. You're
excited.</p>

    <li><h2>3. Be Open to Receiving</h2></li>
    <p>Step 3 is watching how you feel, leaning in to what feels good. We tend
    to get into inspired action during step 3 and "follow our impluses or
    nudges". This is about being open to what you wrote down coming into your
  reality. Maybe it is an idea, a project you've been putting off that
you all of a sudden have more inspiration to start. Or maybe something
unexpected comes into your world without you having to do anything for it.
This can be a refund check in the mail that you didn't expect. A raise at work,
other good news or opportunities. Its noticing that things can happen in our
experience from being more clear, enjoying our life, showing up when
inspiration hits, etc. This is where you being to enjoy the fruitian of your
manifestations. Then we can go back to step 1 over and over again. We continue
to ask, get clear and know that it is coming.</p>
