        <body><p>There are a lot of people on the internet talking about money.
        Even those who don't have any money like to talk about what it takes to generate wealth.
        I've truly heard it all.

        The topic of money -- like most other important topics -- offends, fires up and brings out very strong opinions in people.
        I, as someone who has dedicated her life to the financial empowerment of women, experience this often.
        And since the phrase "become a match for money" has been overused, misinterpreted, and taken way out of context...
        Let's talk about what that means.</p>

          <div id="part-two" class="content">
            <center><span><i>And what it often entails:</i></center></span>

        <br>
        <left>
        <ul> <li>Knowing and accepting your innate worth.</li>
        <li>Normalizing money. (Feeling safe and comfortable with it.)â€¨</li>
        <li>Learning what having, using, receiving, spending money feels like.</li>
        <li>Being open and receptive to money. Letting yourself want it without shame or fear.</li>
        <li>Trusting yourself with money. Knowing and deciding you can handle it.</li>
        <li>Dealing with unhelpful ideas around money (and budgets, debt, responsibility, etc).</li>
        <li>Forming an identity that supports you in having money. (No longer thinking of yourself as the person who never has money and money could never work out for.)</li>
        <li>Letting yourself off the hook for past money mistakes. (Who you have been with money doesn't determine who you will be.)</li>
        <li>Facing money fears. Forgiving money drama. Releasing your money history.</li>
        <l1i>Creating an experience internally that positions you to generate, create and attract (or be a 'match' for) your next level of abundance.</l1i>
        </ul>
       </left>
        As you do this work...

        Becoming a "match" for money in increasing amounts -- while embodying a woman who is comfortable and confident doing so -- can become a way of life for you.
        It's time for fresh perspective, increased ease, and greater joy in your relationship with money.
        Money does not have to be heavy, hard or complicated any longer.
